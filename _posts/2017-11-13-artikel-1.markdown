In the last article, we discuss about [How to change php5 application version to php7 on apache linux?]({{site.url}}/linux/apache/php/2017/09/04/artikel-2/) .  And then now, we will discuss about how to change php version in linux, but not with Apache again. It's about the nginx server. That is, on the FastCGI version.
Before that,We must install php version on fpm formater.

->  php5 version

        $ apt-get install php5-fpm 

-> php7.0 version

        $ apt-get install php7-fpm 


What is the setting?

open the file in the directory /etc/nginx/sites-available/default:

    server {
        listen   80;
        access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
        error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;
        root /var/www/html;
        index index.php index.html;
        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args ;
        }
        location ~ \.php$ {
            fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;
            fastcgi_index index.php;
            include fastcgi_params;
            fastcgi_read_timeout 300;
        }
    }

On the line  _location_ there is  __fastcgi_pass unix:__  which refers to the running _php_ version. In __/var/run/php5-fpm.sock__ , there is the current php5 version is running. To change it, we have to find on directory __/var/run/__   __php7-fpm.sock__ (in my case the file is in the php folder but sometimes it can be found on somewhere else).

    server {
        listen   80;
        access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
        error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;
        root /var/www/html;
        index index.php index.html;
        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args ;
        }
        location ~ \.php$ {
            fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock;
            fastcgi_index index.php;
            include fastcgi_params;
            fastcgi_read_timeout 300;
        }
    }

After that, You must restart nginx

        $ sudo service nginx restart
